Lisp Libraries
=================
Old lisp libraries I made, uncompressed from ancient archives unearthed from dusty external storage devices.

A lot of it is very much derivative of the example code in Paul Graham's "On Lisp", somewhat interpeted for my old tastes. Some of this is purely mine.

Uploaded to github mostly for achaeological purposes.
